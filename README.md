<p align="center">Software Engineer</p>

Software Engineer with a background in Prosthetics and Engineering currently working at [Aurora Energy Research](https://auroraer.com/) (separate work github account, this is my personal), constantly learning and developing myself.

- ⚙️ I’m currently working heavily day to day with **Python**, **AWS**, **SQL** but have experience in/worked a lot in **TypeScript**, **React.js**, **Node.js**, **NoSQL**, and more! (check my website below for the 'more')
- 📄 Familiar with working with **CI/CD** and **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** for AWS and database migrations (mostly worked with **flyway**). Am a sucker for a good pipeline!
- 🌠 My main personal project currently is my playlist transfer website - check out the [backend here](https://github.com/milesbb/playlist-transfer-backend) and the [frontend here](https://github.com/milesbb/playlist-transfer-frontend)! You can read [my manifesto](https://github.com/milesbb/playlist-transfer-backend/blob/main/playlist-sharing-manifesto.md) on why we must rise up and break the stranglehold that Spotify, Apple Music, Big Music Inc. have over the music playlist industry!
- 🌱 Otherwise, I'm currently learning and playing with C and lower level control languages within my prosthetics based mechatronics personal projects
- ✨ Especially interested in Fintech, Meditech, and Language Technology. Though anything vaguely tech-y will pique my interest!
- 📫 You can reach me/learn more at [my website](https://milesbb.tech) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milesbaileybraendgaard/)!
