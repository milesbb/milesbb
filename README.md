Software Engineer with a background in Prosthetics and Engineering currently working at [Aurora Energy Research](https://auroraer.com/) (separate work github account, this is my personal), constantly learning and developing myself.

- ⚙️ I’m currently working heavily day to day with **Python**, **AWS**, **SQL** but have experience in/worked a lot in **TypeScript**, **React.js**, **Node.js**, **NoSQL**, and more! (check my website below for the 'more')
- 📄 Familiar with working with **CI/CD** and **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** for AWS and database migrations (mostly worked with **flyway**)
- 🌱 I'm currently playing with C and lower level control languages within my prosthetics based mechatronics personal projects
- ✨ Especially interested in Fintech, Meditech, and Language Technology. Though anything vaguely tech-y will pique my interest!
